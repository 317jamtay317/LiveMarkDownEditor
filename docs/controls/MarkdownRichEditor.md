# MarkdownRichEditor

The single-pane **WYSIWYG editing surface** of LiveMarkDownEditor. A custom control deriving from
`RichTextBox` that shows a Markdown Document as a formatted **Visual Document** — a heading looks
like a heading, bold is bold — so the user edits content **without ever seeing raw Markdown
syntax**, while the canonical Markdown source is exposed for binding.

- **Class:** `UI.Controls.MarkdownRichEditor`
- **Default style:** `src/UI/Controls/MarkdownRichEditor.xaml` (merged in `App.xaml`)
- **Base:** `System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox`

This is the one place in the UI where interaction logic lives outside a ViewModel, per the project's
Control exception to the zero-code-behind rule.

## Purpose

Keep two representations of the same content in sync:

- **Project** — assigning `Markdown` parses it (GFM) and builds the Visual Document shown to the user.
- **Capture** — when the user edits the Visual Document, the control serialises it back to canonical
  Markdown and pushes it to `Markdown`.

The heavy lifting lives in `UI.Wysiwyg.MarkdownToFlowDocumentProjector` and
`UI.Wysiwyg.FlowDocumentToMarkdownCapturer`; the control orchestrates them and guards against the
two directions echoing each other.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Markdown` | `string` | `""` | The canonical Markdown source text. **Binds two-way by default.** Setting it Projects a new Visual Document; editing the surface Captures back into it. |
| `IsCaretInTable` | `bool` | `false` | Whether the caret sits inside a Table — the availability switch for the Table Formatting Actions (Insert Table only outside, Add Row / Add Column only inside). |
| `FindQuery` | `string` | `""` | The Find query. Every occurrence in the Visual Document is highlighted as a Match. |
| `IsFindActive` | `bool` | `false` | Whether the Find Bar is open. Setting it false clears the Find highlights. |
| `Replacement` | `string` | `""` | The text a Match is swapped for, inserted verbatim (INV-022). |
| `IsReplaceActive` | `bool` | `false` | Whether the Find Bar's Replace Row is shown. Ctrl+H opens the Find Bar with it; Ctrl+F without. |
| `MatchCount` | `int` | `0` | **Read-only.** The number of Matches for the current `FindQuery`. |
| `MatchSummary` | `string` | `""` | **Read-only.** The Find Bar's summary: empty with no query, `"No results"`, or `"{ordinal} of {count}"`. |

## Formatting Actions (Toggle Code, Lists &amp; Tables)

Formatting Actions are real edits: they change the Visual Document, which Captures back into
`Markdown` like any other edit, always to canonical Markdown (INV-018). They are driven through
`UI.Controls.MarkdownEditingCommands` routed commands (wire a button or menu item with
`CommandTarget` aimed at the editor), or called directly:

| Member | Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ToggleCodeAtSelection()` | `ToggleCode` | A selection within a single line becomes a Code Span; a selection spanning multiple lines, or a whole line, becomes a Code Block; inside existing code the code formatting is removed. Enabled when text is selected or the caret is in code. |
| `InsertTableAtCaret()` | `InsertTable` | Inserts a new Table — three columns, a header row, two empty body rows — at the caret and selects the first header cell. Enabled only while the caret is **not** in a Table. |
| `AddTableRowAtCaret()` | `AddTableRow` | Inserts a new empty row below the caret's row, at the Table's column count (INV-019). Enabled only while the caret is in a Table. |
| `AddTableColumnAtCaret()` | `AddTableColumn` | Inserts a new empty column right of the caret's column, extending every row (INV-019). Enabled only while the caret is in a Table. |
| `ToggleUnorderedListAtSelection()` | `ToggleUnorderedList` | The selected paragraphs become an Unordered List; an Unordered List becomes plain paragraphs again; an Ordered List is converted rather than removed (INV-023). |
| `ToggleOrderedListAtSelection()` | `ToggleOrderedList` | The counterpart of Toggle Unordered List, for Ordered Lists (INV-023). |
| `ToggleTaskListAtSelection()` | `ToggleTaskList` | Gives every selected List Item lacking one an unchecked Task Marker, or clears them all when every selected List Item already carries one. Outside a List it makes the selected paragraphs an Unordered List first, since a Task Marker exists only on a List Item. An Unordered Task List shows no bullet — the checkbox is the item's marker (INV-023). |

The formatting logic lives in `UI.Wysiwyg.CodeFormatting`, `UI.Wysiwyg.TableEditing`, and
`UI.Wysiwyg.ListFormatting`, which the Projector shares, so Capture treats user-applied code, Tables,
and Lists exactly like ones loaded from Markdown.

## Toggle Task Marker (clicking a checkbox)

Clicking a Task Marker's checkbox toggles it between `[ ]` and `[x]`. This is a real edit, but it is
**not** a Formatting Action: it reaches the document by direct manipulation rather than through the
command bar or a key gesture, so it has no routed command (INV-024).

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ToggleTaskMarkerAt(TextPointer? position)` | Flips the Task Marker at `position`, changing nothing else. Returns `false` — and makes no edit — when the position is not on a Task Marker, so the click places the caret as usual. Called by the control's `OnPreviewMouseLeftButtonDown`. |
| `ContinueTaskListAtCaret()` | Breaks the line in a task item and gives the new List Item its own unchecked Task Marker, the way a bullet or a number carries to the next item (INV-023). Returns `false` outside a task item, so Enter behaves as usual. Called by the control's `OnPreviewKeyDown`. |
| `MarkContinuedTaskItemAtCaret()` | The rule behind the above, on its own: marks the List Item at the caret when the item before it is a task item and it is not. Split out because the paragraph break runs through a WPF editing command that needs a focused editor, so only this half is testable headless. |

`UI.Wysiwyg.TaskMarkerEditing` is the one definition of a Task Marker: it composes the marker (glyph
plus role) for the Projector, `ListFormatting`, and this toggle alike, and updates the glyph and the
role together so what the user sees and what Capture emits can never disagree. The marker owns the
single space separating its checkbox from the item's text — the Projector strips the one the Markdown
source carries on the following text, and Capture re-emits it as `"[ ] "`.

## Folding (collapsible Sections)

The editor can **Fold** a Section — hide a heading's Section Body up to the next heading of equal or
higher level, the way Visual Studio collapses a region. Folding is **view-only**: Folded bodies are
retained and Captured in place, so a Fold never changes `Markdown` (INV-011). Section boundaries are
computed by the pure `UI.Wysiwyg.SectionMap`.

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Fold(Block heading)` | Folds the Section led by `heading`. Throws `ArgumentException` if the block is not a Section Heading. |
| `Unfold(Block heading)` | Restores the Section's Section Body. |
| `ToggleFold(Block heading)` | Folds if Unfolded, Unfolds if Folded. |
| `ToggleFoldAtCaret()` | Toggles the Fold of the Section containing the caret. |
| `CollapseAllFolds()` | Folds every Section, collapsing the document to its top-level Section Headings. |
| `ExpandAllFolds()` | Unfolds every Folded Section. |
| `IsFolded(Block heading)` | Whether the Section is currently Folded. |
| `IsSectionHeading(Block block)` | Whether the block is a Section Heading (a foldable heading). Used by the Editor Gutter to place a Fold Toggle. |
| `Capture()` | Captures the full logical document (visible blocks with Folded bodies spliced back in) to canonical Markdown. |

Folds are driven from the UI through the `UI.Controls.MarkdownEditingCommands` routed commands
(`ToggleFold` — Ctrl+M; `CollapseAllFolds`; `ExpandAllFolds` — Ctrl+Shift+M), which the control
handles via command bindings, and through the per-heading Fold Toggle chevrons in the
[Editor Gutter](EditorGutter.md). Folds are presentation state and are cleared whenever `Markdown`
is re-Projected.

## Find &amp; Replace

**Find** locates every occurrence of `FindQuery` in the Visual Document and highlights them through
the [Find Highlight Adorner](FindHighlightAdorner.md). Find is **view-only**: it highlights, scrolls,
and selects, but never changes `Markdown` (INV-016). The scan is the pure `UI.Find.MatchScanner`,
which snapshots the document's text, delegates the search to `UI.Find.MatchFinder`, and maps the
Matches back to ranges — so a Match may span an inline formatting boundary but never bridges two
blocks.

**Replace** is the part that edits: it swaps a Match for the `Replacement` and Captures the result
back into `Markdown` like any other edit (INV-022).

| Member | Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| — | `ShowFind` | Opens the Find Bar and focuses the query box (Ctrl+F). Leaves the Replace Row hidden. |
| — | `ShowReplace` | Opens the Find Bar **with** the Replace Row (Ctrl+H). |
| — | `HideFind` | Closes the Find Bar and its Replace Row, clearing the highlights (Escape). |
| — | `FindNext` / `FindPrevious` | Move the Current Match, wrapping around the ends (F3 / Shift+F3). Enabled while there are Matches. |
| `ReplaceCurrentMatch()` | `Replace` | Swaps the Current Match for the `Replacement`, then moves to the next Match. Enabled while there are Matches — it acts on the Current Match, so it needs one. |
| `ReplaceAllMatches()` | `ReplaceAll` | Swaps every Match for the `Replacement` in one undoable edit. Enabled whenever there is a query — deliberately **not** gated on `MatchCount`, because the occurrences it exists to catch may all be hidden inside Folded Sections, leaving the count at zero. |

Four behaviours are worth knowing, all pinned by `MarkdownRichEditorReplaceTests`:

- **A Replacement is verbatim.** A Match is found case-insensitively, but the Replacement is never
  re-cased to suit it. An empty Replacement deletes the Match — the way to delete every occurrence.
- **Formatting is inherited only when the Match has one.** Replacing a word inside bold text leaves
  it bold; a Match *spanning* a formatting boundary (`**bo**ld`) has no single formatting to inherit,
  so its Replacement is plain. This holds for bold, italic, code, and strikethrough alike.
- **Replace All Unfolds first.** Find searches only the *visible* document, so an occurrence inside a
  Folded Section Body is invisible to it while still being present in `Markdown`. Replace All calls
  `ExpandAllFolds()` and re-finds before replacing, so "All" means the whole Markdown Document.
- **Replace All is one edit.** It replaces a snapshot of the ranges taken before the first edit — so
  a Replacement containing the query cannot cascade — wrapped in `BeginChange()`/`EndChange()`, which
  makes the batch a single undo unit. WPF attaches no undo stack until the control is loaded in a
  visual tree, so the undo grouping is verified by driving Ctrl+Z in the running app rather than by a
  headless test.

## Outline &amp; Navigation

The editor exposes its **Outline** — every Section Heading, in document order — so the
[Navigation Panel](OutlinePanel.md) can list them and jump between them. The Outline lists *all*
Section Headings, including ones inside a Folded Section Body, so it always mirrors the whole
document. Reading the Outline and Navigating are **view-only**: neither changes `Markdown` (INV-012).

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Outline` | `IReadOnlyList<SectionHeading>` — every Section Heading (level + text) in document order, Folded ones included. Each `SectionHeading` is an Outline Entry. |
| `Navigate(SectionHeading heading)` | Reveals the heading (Unfolding its enclosing Section if hidden), selects it, and scrolls it into view. |
| `CurrentSection` | The `SectionHeading` whose Section most immediately encloses the caret, or `null`. |
| `OutlineChanged` (event) | Raised when the Outline may have changed (re-Projection or a structural edit). |
| `CurrentSectionChanged` (event) | Raised when the Current Section may have changed (caret move or re-Projection). |

## Events

Inherits `RichTextBox` events, plus `OutlineChanged` and `CurrentSectionChanged` (above). The control
overrides `OnTextChanged` internally to drive Capture; consumers bind to `Markdown` rather than
handling text-changed directly.

## Behaviour notes

- **Formatting is detected by effective run properties**, so both formatting loaded from Markdown
  and formatting applied via the toolbar (`EditingCommands.ToggleBold` / `ToggleItalic`, which set
  `FontWeight` / `FontStyle`) round-trip to `**` / `*`.
- **Re-entrancy guard:** an internal flag plus a "last captured" comparison stop a Capture-driven
  update to `Markdown` from re-Projecting (which would reset the caret).
- **Live external updates:** when the bound Editor Session replaces `Markdown` (e.g. the Watched
  File changed on disk), the Visual Document is re-Projected to match.

## Usage

```xml
<controls:MarkdownRichEditor
    Markdown="{Binding Markdown, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}" />
```

Bind `Markdown` to the Editor Session's canonical source text. Add formatting buttons that target the
editor by name:

```xml
<Button Content="B" Command="EditingCommands.ToggleBold"
        CommandTarget="{Binding ElementName=Editor}" />
```

## Supported Markdown constructs

Headings, paragraphs, bold, italic, strikethrough, Code Spans, fenced and indented Code Blocks,
Unordered and Ordered Lists (with nesting), task-list items, Links, autolinks, Images, Block
Quotes, Thematic Breaks, GFM Tables (with column alignment), and hard line breaks all round-trip —
see `docs/Invariants.md` (INV-004) for the authoritative list.
